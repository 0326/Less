A simple minimal WordPress theme built with only what is needed to survive

Less is a super minimal theme, both front end and back end. adding no bloat whatesover. it only uses the minimum requirements that WordPress has, a style sheet, screenshot and the index page. 

I did use LESS (http://lesscss.org/) for all the styles, if you know how to use it you will be able to change a few viarables to customize the site with no problem!
